This means the people were using the stones to keep track of the stars, moon, and sun. Sometimes they called these stones the Giants' Dance. By this point in history we noticed that the sun always rises and sets along the East and West horizon line. By creating a circle of stones, early Sapiens were able to track the path of the sun with the shadows made by the stones on the ground. The shadows changed a little each day throughout the year giving us an early calendar for determining planting and harvesting during different seasons of that year.
